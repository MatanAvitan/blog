Over the years I have been an IT man and developer in various forms,
And always, wherever I was, there was a tension between the IT professionals and the developers.
On the one hand developers want to reach the destination that was presented to them and try to give delivery,
On the other hand, IT professionals want to provide a professional and high-quality solution, such as sufficient servers, storage and technical support In case of technical malfunctions.
In principle, I believe that such an emotional clash between two groups can lead to disaster, even though they both want the same goal, the company's success.
Over the years, dozens, if not hundreds, of methods of talking about this bridge between the worlds have risen and fallen, but this has never matured into a practical method. Why?
There are some explanations for this,
As a high-tech man who has lived in the past and still experiences both worlds, I can say clearly that two things led us to develop DevOps methodology under the Agile development methodology:
1. BigData - Over the past decade, as Data & Information in the world has multiplied more than once.
more and more developers have demanded more and more computing resources from IT professionals,
When such a demand comes to an IT professional, he has two options: ScaleUp or ScaleOut,
In the early years of the virtualization world there was a very big buzz around ScaleUp and everyone simply added resources in a hot way to the development servers at the user's request,
But we are talking about the BigData diaper period since machine learning and indexing and retrieval algorithms have improved but require more powerful processors such as GPUs and faster servers,
The burden of manually installing and installing thousands of servers in large enterprise organizations was very demanding for IT professionals until organizations realized at some point that this graph of computing resources as a human function was accelerating faster than we thought and needed to be solved.
2. Changing the concept of development - In the past the development method was monolithic,
The development team was met with customers at the beginning of the project for a set of meetings and then going out for development of a few months at best, or for the development of several years at worst.
Why did this cause?
At best, the developers came back with a good product, but in such a long period of time, the product that development has already lost from its relevance or has already gained market-based competitors.
In the worst case, the development did not meet the demands of the customers and now has to go out for another expensive and wasteful development period.

The two reasons I mentioned above led to the development of the Agile approach and to the development of the DevOps methodology.
